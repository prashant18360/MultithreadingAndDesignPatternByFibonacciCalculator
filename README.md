# MultithreadingByFibonacciNumberCalculator
implement a producer-consumer based Fibonacci number calculator in Java by using explicit multithreading. The program starts by asking the user about the total number of consumer threads to generate. This interaction will happen on a producer thread that will first create all the consumer threads, and then endlessly loop asking the user to enter the number whose Fibonacci number is to be calculated. The producer thread will not display the result for any input number provided by the user unless the user explicitly asks the producer thread to display the result of all pending queries. The producer will terminate only when specified by the user.
